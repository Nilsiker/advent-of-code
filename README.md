## Introduction

Hi and welcome to my Advent of Code repository! üéÑ

In the best of worlds, this repo would contain all puzzle solutions for every attempted year. 

But as we all know, December can be a stressful time - so we'll just have to see how much time my work and everyday life leaves me to tinker with this. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
